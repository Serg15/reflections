Question 1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you work with a team or when you work from different computers

Question 2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote 
repository?
Because probably there are some changes that you dont want to share yet.
